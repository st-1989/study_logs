# My First Blog Post

This is my first real blog post. Let me show you some of the cool things you can do with Jupyter Book.

## Writing Content

You can write content in Markdown or Jupyter notebooks. This gives you flexibility to:
- Write plain text and formatted content
- Include code and its output
- Add images, tables, and more

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Python code block:

```python
def greet(name):
    """A simple greeting function"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Test it out
message = greet("World")
print(message)
```

Output: `Hello, World!`

## Mathematical Equations

Jupyter Book supports LaTeX math notation:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Inline math also works: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$

## Lists and Structure

Here's what I learned today:

1. Setting up Jupyter Book is straightforward
2. GitHub Actions makes deployment automatic
3. Markdown is powerful for documentation

### Bullet Points

- Easy to write
- Easy to read
- Great for notes

## Next Steps

In my next post, I'll explore:
- Adding Jupyter notebooks with executable code
- Creating interactive visualizations
- Organizing content into sections

Thanks for reading!
