# Sample Page

This is an extra sample page that demonstrates additional content in the blog.

## What This Page Shows

This page is an example of how easy it is to add new content to your Jupyter Book blog. You can:

- Create new pages by adding Markdown files
- Link to them from other pages
- Organize your content hierarchically

## Content Examples

### Lists and Formatting

Here are some things you can do with Markdown:

1. **Bold text** for emphasis
2. *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
3. `Code snippets` for technical content
4. Links to [other resources](https://jupyterbook.org/)

### Code Blocks

You can include code examples:

```python
# A simple Python example
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from the sample page!")

hello_world()
```

### Quotes

> "The best way to learn is by doing and sharing what you learn."
